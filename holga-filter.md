## Holga 120 Cameras Filter Adapter
Holga 120 cameras filter adapter. Please note the step up ring and filter required are shown but not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit Holga 120 cameras. Requires a 43mm step up ring [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_43mm_step_up_ring_url }}) to suit whatever filters you wish to use.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Gently screw or push a 43mm step up ring into the front of the adapter.
2. Push the adapter onto the lens.
3. Screw your favourite filter into the step up ring.
