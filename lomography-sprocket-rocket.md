## Lomography Sprocket Rocket Shutter Release Cable Adapter
Lomography Sprocket Rocket Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_cable_url}}). Camera shown is not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Lomography Sprocket Rocket camera. It allows you to use a shutter release cable for beautiful long exposure pictures or selfies.

This uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you donâ€™t plan on removing it again.

Please note the clip used to give the adapter extra rigidity is secured in place using the 1/4 inch screw that comes with the camera or a tripod screw. Unfortunately, many tripod screws are rediculously short. If you need to use the clip and your tripod has a short screw you can either source a longer one or use a 1/4 inch male to 1/4 inch female thumb screw adapter. These are readily available on market places such as Amazon and eBay. Please contact me for help if you need it.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Set the exposure switch to B.
2. As you look at the camera, slide the adapter in from the left with the shutter button lever over the shutter button.
3. Twist the adapter anti-clockwise so that the bottom is level with the base of the camera.
4. Push the clip into place and secure it with the bolt that comes with the camera or a tripod.
5. After use set the exposure switch back to N again.

Note if you use this be careful if handling the camera whilst the shutter is open or you may spoil your photos by disturbing the adapter!

To remove:

1. Remove the release cable from the adapter.
2. Remove the retaining clip.
3. Rotate the adapter clockwise and remove it.

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, it is robust.

### Reviews

> "The Sprocket Rocket cable release adapter from Sparrow Fabrications was excellent. Gone are the days of needing to use a rubber band to make long exposures."
