## Diana Instant Square Shutter Release Cable Adapter
Diana Instant Square Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09126NKPN).

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Diana Instant Square camera. It allows you to use a shutter release cable for beautiful long exposure pictures or selfies.

This uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you donâ€™t plan on removing it again.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Set the exposure switch to B.
2. Position the upper and lower adapter pieces between the case and the buttons and firmly press them together (Photos 4 & 5).
3. Push the assembled adapter back towards the camera body for a snug fit.
4. Screw release cable into the adapter through the top as shown.
5. After use set the exposure switch back to N again.

Note if you use this be careful if handling the camera whilst the shutter is open or you may spoil your photos by disturbing the adapter!

To remove:

1. Remove the release cable from the adapter.
2. Gently pull the adapter forwards away from the camera body to loosen.
3. Separate the upper and lower pieces of the adapter.

Note the upper and lower pieces of the adapter are purposefully snug so firmly press the lower half towards you and the upper half away from you on each side close to the lugs.
