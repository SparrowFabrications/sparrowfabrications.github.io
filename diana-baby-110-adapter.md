## Lomography Diana Baby 110 Shutter Release Cable Adapter
Lomography Diana Baby 110 Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_cable_url }}). Camera shown is not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Diana Baby 110 camera. It allows you to use a shutter release cable for beautiful long exposure pictures. This is intended to be used with a tripod to secure the adpater in place. It has an integrated tripod mount to allow you to seat the camera on a tripod.

This uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you donâ€™t plan on removing it again.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Set the exposure switch to B.
2. Gently push the adapter over the lens on the camera until it touches the camera body with no gaps.
3. Screw release cable into the adapter as shown.
4. After use set the exposure switch back to N again.

Note, whilst the adapter is in use be careful handling the camera or you may spoil your photos by disturbing the adapter!

To remove:

1. Remove the release cable from the adapter.
2. Gently pull the adapter forwards away from the camera body to loosen.
3. Gently remove by pushing the prongs of the adapter body apart.
