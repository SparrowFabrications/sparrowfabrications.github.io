## Belair X 6-12 Shutter Release Cable Adapter
Lomography Belair X 6-12 Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_cable_url }}).

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Belair X 6-12 camera. It allows you to use a shutter release cable for beautiful long exposure pictures.

This adapter is push fit, it fits snuggly on the side of the camera body.

This adapter uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you donâ€™t plan on removing it again. Also, it is best to fit this cable before mounting the adapter on the camera.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Note the ISO dial setting then set the ISO dial to B.
2. Screw release cable into the adapter through the bottom.
3. Push adapter onto the camera.
4. After use return the ISO dial to it's previous setting.

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, it is robust.
