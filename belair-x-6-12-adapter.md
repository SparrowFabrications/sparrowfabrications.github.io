## Belair X 6-12 Shutter Release Cable Adapter
Lomography Belair X 6-12 Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_cable_url }}). Camera shown is not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Belair X 6-12 camera. It allows you to use a shutter release cable for beautiful long exposure pictures.

This adapter is push fit, it fits snuggly on the side of the camera body.

This adapter uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you donâ€™t plan on removing it again. Also, it is best to fit this cable before mounting the adapter on the camera.

Please note, the Belair requires quite a bit of force to depress the shutter button. Hence, this adapter requires a reasonably good quality shutter release cable to work correctly. Avoid bending the cable past 90 degrees relative to the securing point or you may find that the cable is not strong enough to depress the shutter button fully. For best results keep the shutter release cable as straight as possible.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Note the ISO dial setting then set the ISO dial to B.
2. Screw release cable into the adapter through the bottom.
3. Push adapter onto the camera.
4. After use return the ISO dial to it's previous setting.

Note, whilst the adapter is in use be careful handling the camera or you may spoil your photos by disturbing the adapter!
