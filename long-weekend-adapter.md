## Long Weekend Shutter Release Cable Adapter
Long Weekend Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_cable_url }}). Camera shown is not included. Also, note the step up ring and filter required are shown but not included. Requires a 30mm step up ring to suit whatever filters you wish to use.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Long Weekend. It allows you to use a shutter release cable and filters.

This adapter is push fit, it fits snuggly over and around the lens.

This adapter uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you donâ€™t plan on removing it again.

Please note you can secure this adapter in place using a thumb screw adapter or by mounting it on a tripod. Unfortunately, many tripod screws are ridiculously short. If your tripod has a short screw you can either source a longer one or use a 1/4 inch male to 1/4 inch female thumb screw adapter. These are readily available on market places such as Amazon and eBay. Please contact me for help if you need it.

### Directions for use
To use with a cable:

1. Attached the cable anchor to the adapter.
2. Screw release cable into the adapter through the top as shown.
3. Push adapter onto the camera as shown starting with the bottom edge.
4. Optionally secure the adapter with a thumb screw or a tripod.

To use with a filter:

1. Gently screw or push a 30mm step up ring into the front of the adapter.
2. Push adapter onto the camera as shown.
3. Insert the adapter retainer into the flash bar and click it down into the adapter.
