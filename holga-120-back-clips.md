## Holga 120 Replacement Back Clips
A pair of replacement back clips for Holga 120 cameras. These replace the rather flimsy standard clips which tend to fall off at inconvenient times.

These clips are designed to hold the back in place more sturdily. They slide into place and are designed to fit tightly.

There are loops built into the clips to attach a strap.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Holga 120 camera and its variants.

### Directions for use
Simply remove your current back clips and slide these into place.

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, it is robust.
