## Where to buy?
If you are in the UK and would like to save me the platform fees you can purchase directly from me using PayPal, please contact me first via email at **{{ site.email_address }}**.

Alternatively you can purchase via:

- [eBay UK]({{ site.ebay_uk_url }}) or [eBay US]({{ site.ebay_us_url}}), and
- [Etsy]({{ site.etsy_url }}).

Please note that eBay charges a shipping cost per item and where multiple items are purchased I refund excess postage after tax and fees.

## What about shipping?
I use Royal Mail for domestic and international shipping. Royal Mail is very competitive internationally as they own their own aircraft then hand off to local shipping partners in the destination country.

I do not profit from shipping and merely cover my costs.

Typical shipping costs are:

- Â£1.65 to the United Kingdom via Royal Mail Second Class.
- $12.00 to the United States via a Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed.
- $6.50 to the United States via a Royal Mail Standard Delivery (no tracking).

Please note that where possible I use recyclable packaging, I make an effort to reuse padded envelopes and packaging and to reduce the impact on our environment. This is not about reducing costs as padded envelopes are very economical to buy in bulk.
