## Diana Instant Square Filter Adapter
Diana Instant Square Filter Adapter. Please note the step up ring and filter required are shown but not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Lomography Diana Instant Square. Requires a 37mm step up ring [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_37mm_step_up_ring_url }}) to suit whatever filters you wish to use.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Gently screw or push a 37mm step up ring into the front of the adapter.
2. Push the adapter onto the lens.
3. Screw your favourite filter into the step up ring.

### Supported Cameras
Tested with:
- Lomography Diana Instant Square

It is not compatible with the Lomography Diana+ or F+, Diana Baby or Diana Mini or the Vintage Diana (1960s) and Clone Cameras.

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, it is robust.
