## Diana Mini Filter Adapter
Diana Mini Filter Adapter. Please note the step up ring and filter required are shown but not included. Camera shown is not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Lomography Diana Mini. Requires a 30mm step up ring [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_30mm_step_up_ring_url }}) to suit whatever filters you wish to use.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Gently screw or push a 30mm step up ring into the front of the adapter.
2. Push the adapter onto the lens.
3. Screw your favourite filter into the step up ring.

### Supported Cameras
Tested with:
- Diana Mini

It is not compatible with the Lomography Diana F+, Diana+, Vintage Diana (1960s) and Clone Cameras, Lomography Diana Instant Square or Diana Baby.
