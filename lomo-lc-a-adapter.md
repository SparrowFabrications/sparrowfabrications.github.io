## LOMO LC-A Shutter Release Cable Adapter
LOMO LC-A Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_cable_url }}). Camera shown is not included. Also, note the step up ring and filter required are shown but not included. Requires a 30mm step up ring [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_30mm_step_up_ring_url }}) to suit whatever filters you wish to use.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the LOMO LC-A camera. It allows you to use a shutter release cable and filters.

This adapter is push fit, it fits snuggly over and around the lens, whilst allowing access to the iso setting, aperture lever, focus lever and lens switch. Use of this adapter prevents use of the flash hot shoe.

This adapter uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you donâ€™t plan on removing it again.

### Directions for use
To use with a cable:

1. Attached the cable anchor to the adapter.
2. Screw release cable into the adapter through the top as shown.
3. Push adapter onto the camera as shown starting with the bottom edge.
4. Slide the adapter retainer into the flash hot shoe and click it down into the adapter.

To use with a filter:

1. Gently screw or push a 30mm step up ring into the front of the adapter.
2. Push adapter onto the camera as shown.
3. Insert the adapter retainer into the flash bar and click it down into the adapter.

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, it is robust.
