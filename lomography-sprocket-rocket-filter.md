## Lomography Sprocket Rocket Filter Adapter
Lomography Sprocket Rocket Filter Adapter. Please note the step up ring and filter required are shown but not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Lomography Sprocket Rocket camera. Requires a 43mm step up ring [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_43mm_step_up_ring_url }}) to suit whatever filters you wish to use.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Gently screw or push a 43mm step up ring into the front of the adapter.
2. Push the adapter onto the lens.
3. Screw your favourite filter into the step up ring.

Note, please leave a slight gap between the inside face of the adapter and the screws in the front of the lens. This will allow you to change the focus without the back of the adapter catching the screws.

### Supported Cameras
Tested with:
- Lomography Sprocket Rocket 1.0

Should be compatible with:
- Lomography Sprocket Rocket 2.0

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, it is robust.
