## LomoApparat Shutter Release Cable Adapter
LomoApparat Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_cable_url }}). Camera shown is not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the LomoApparat camera. It allows you to use a shutter release cable for beautiful long exposures.

This adapter slides into place and is secured into place using the cable anchor. It fits snuggly over and around the lens. It comes with its own lens cap which is only compatible with this adapter, it does not fit the camera separately.

You can mount the LomoApparat Close Up, Kaleidoscope and Splitzer lens attachments onto this adapter as shown.

This adapter uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you donâ€™t plan on removing it again.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Set the exposure switch to B.
2. Screw release cable into the adapter through the top as shown.
3. Slide the adapter onto the camera and secure with the cable anchor as shown.
4. After use set the exposure switch back to N again.
