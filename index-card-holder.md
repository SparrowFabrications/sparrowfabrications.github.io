## Index Card Holder
Index Card Holder to remind you what film, type and format you are shooting. Never forget what film you are shooting again!

### Directions for use
Simply attach this index card holder to your camera using the sticky pad provided, then tear off the end of the film box and insert it into the holder.

### Supported Cameras
Suitable for cameras shooting 120 format film such as Holgas and Dianaâ€™s shown, but could fit any suitable camera and film box.

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, is robust.
