## Belair X 6-12 Filter Adapter
Belair X 6-12 Filter Adapter. Please note the step up ring and filter required are shown but not included. Camera shown is not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Belair X 6-12 camera. This fits both of the supplied lenses. Requires a 30mm step up ring [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_30mm_step_up_ring_url }}) to suit whatever filters you wish to use.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Gently screw or push a 30mm step up ring into the front of the adapter.
2. Push the adapter onto the lens.
3. Screw your favourite filter into the step up ring.

### Supported Cameras
Tested with:
- Belair X 6-12
