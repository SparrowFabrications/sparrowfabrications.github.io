## Diana F+ Shutter Release Cable Adapter
Diana F+ 120 Shutter Release Cable Adapter. Please note the cable required is shown but not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Diana F+ 120 camera. It allows you to use a shutter release cable for beautiful long exposure pictures. Works with the Diana F+ only, I think the original Diana might have a slightly wider lens casing.

This adapter comes in four parts and requires a very small amount of self assembly. When you receive it use the bolt provided to secure the shutter switch in place. The shutter switch shouldn't rock but it should move freely.

Works with cables [such as this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09126NKPN).

This uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you don’t plan on removing it again.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Set the exposure switch to B.
2. Position the upper and lower adapter pieces between the case and the buttons and firmly press them together (Photos 6 & 7).
3. Push the assembled adapter back towards the camera body for a snug fit (Photo 8).
4. Additionally, you may use provided tripod retaining clip when bolting to a tripod (Photo 9).
5. Screw release cable into the adapter through the top as shown.
6. After use set the exposure switch back to N again.

Note if you use this be careful if handling the camera whilst the shutter is open or you may spoil your photos by disturbing the adapter!

To remove:

1. Remove the release cable from the adapter.
2. Gently pull the adapter forwards away from the camera body to loosen.
3. Separate the upper and lower pieces of the adapter.

Note the upper and lower pieces of the adapter are purposefully snug so firmly press the lower half towards you and the upper half away from you on each side close to the lugs.

### Supported Cameras
Tested with:
- Diana F+

It is not compatible with the original Diana or Diana Mini.

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, it is robust.

### Reviews

> The release arrived safely, was a doddle to put together and although I’ve not yet used it to take photos I have fitted it to the camera and it fits perfectly! Over my many years in photography I’ve seen a number of brackets made to attach cable releases to cameras but this is without a doubt the best!

> This adapter fits and works brilliantly and with absolutely no effort to install. The tripod retaining clip is also a super idea! I use the 'glass' lens on my Diana F+ and the adapter did not in any way interfere with the usage of the camera and that lens. It is as good as the original Diana F+ shutter release, which is now a very hard-to-find accessory.
