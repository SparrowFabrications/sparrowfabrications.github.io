## Holga 120 Shutter Release Cable Adapter
Holga 120 Shutter Release Cable Adapter with shutter button extender. Please note the cable required is shown but not included. Works with cables [such as this one]({{ site.amazon_cable_url }}). Camera shown is not included.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the Holga 120 camera and its variants. It allows you to use a shutter release cable for beautiful long exposure pictures.

This adapter is push fit, it fits snuggly over and around the lens, whilst allowing access to the Tripod mount, exposure switch and aperture switch. It also has a focal distance indicator so you can correctly set focal distance with the adapter in place.

The shutter button extender is optional and provided if you wish to permanently attach your adapter to your camera. It can be glued to your existing shutter button with super glue.

Please note this adapter may decrease the amount of light your Holga leaks, which could be an advantage or disadvantage according to your preferences.

This adapter uses a linear threaded nut to hold the shutter release cable so it is best not to screw the cable in too tight unless you don’t plan on removing it again. Also, it is best to fit this cable before mounting the adapter on the camera.

### Directions for use
To use:

1. Set the exposure switch to B.
2. Screw release cable into the adapter through the top as shown.

> I was looking of one of these for my Holgas. This is exactly what I wanted, it fits nicely over the front of the Holga and my cable release just fits in exactly. I just need to load it with film and away I go☺️
