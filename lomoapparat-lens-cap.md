## LomoApparat Replacement Lens Cap
A replacement lens cap for LomoApparat cameras.

There is an eyelet so you may attach a lens cap retention strap.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the LomoApparat camera.

### Directions for use
Simply slide into place and lift the bottom edge slightly to allow the securing tab to pass over the bottom of the lens rim.

### Supported Cameras
Tested with:
- LomoApparat

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, it is robust.
