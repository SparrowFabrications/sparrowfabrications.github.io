## LomoApparat Replacement Lens Cap
A replacement lens cap for LomoApparat cameras. Camera shown is not included.

There is an eyelet so you may attach a lens cap retention strap.

Designed by me from scratch to fit the LomoApparat camera.

### Directions for use
Simply slide into place and lift the bottom edge slightly to allow the securing tab to pass over the bottom of the lens rim.

### Supported Cameras
Tested with:
- LomoApparat

#### Reviews

>Thick, durable material and fits my LomoApparat perfectly! So glad I found this item after losing my original lens cap during my trip. Seller was responsive too when I inquired about international shipping.
