## Welcome!
I manufacture accessories for cameras including the Holga and Diana to allow photography and lomography enthusiasts like myself to get the most out of their cameras.

### Products
Products are individually 3D printed and finished by me. You can purchase products directly from me or from:

### Feedback
I have had some great feedback about my products which you can see in my product pages.

>Sparrow Fabrications' Holga shutter release adapter is well designed, fits like a glove and works absolutely perfectly. Only item on the market to fit this need. Absolutely perfect! Many Thanks.

I do ask for feedback on my products directly so I can continue to improve them.

### Design
The design of my current products has evolved quite a bit based on me using them and from feedback from purchasers. If you have any questions you are welcome to contact me at **info@sparrowfabrications.co.uk**.

If you have an idea for a product let me know. In the past I have made specific parts for fellow enthusiasts.
