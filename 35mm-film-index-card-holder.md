### Reviews
> Simple, straightforward and once found on the back of every film camera. Simple concept -stick it onto the camera, tear off the top of the film carton and slide it in and you stand a fair chance of remembering what stock is in which body. Now very hard to find a robust version. This certainly meets that spec and is genuinely useful. Recommended.

### Manufacturing
3D printed in PETG, finished and posted from the United Kingdom. I chose PETG as it is a strong material and the design, although it looks delicate, is robust.
